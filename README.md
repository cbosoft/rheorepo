# rheorepo
Contains data tables/papers/textbooks with information on the viscosity of various compounds and solutions

To keep it neat, each entry in this repository should be of the form:

``` [species name]_[table||function]_[temperature range]_[paper key].pdf ```

If the species is a solution, then the compositions could be added too.

So for a paper giving the viscosity of glycerol and its aqueous solutions at various temperatures (e.g. [Segur 1951](http://edge.rit.edu/edge/P13051/public/Research%20Notes/Viscosity%20of%20Aqueous%20Glycerol%20Solutions.pdf)), the title could be:

```glycerol+water_table_0c-100c_0wt-100wt_SEGUR1951.pdf```
